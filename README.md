# CSV-2-Pandas (csv2sqlNback)
Scripts to transfer csv data to a mysql database and/or query a mysql database and download the results into a Pandas dataframe or csv

For some reason, this process caused me nonstop trouble and took way longer than it should have.  Hopefully, if you're struggling with this as much as I was, these scripts will help.  

I'm using Mac OS Catalina, fwiw.
